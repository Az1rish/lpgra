            "President Margaret Jacoby called the meeting to order with the Pledge of Allegiance.",
            "Members Present: Margaret Jacoby, Dave Eason, Sharon Hauser, Walt Smiles, Peggy Marcone.",
            "Sharon Hauser read a short motivational/inspirational” message.",
            "The minutes of the February 6, 2020 meeting are posted on the website and sent to lpgra.org email list.  Motion to accept as posted was made, seconded and adopted.",
            "Officer Dawn Blake was a guest speaker.  She addressed some major issues that might affect residents of LPG.  The one category she stressed was that of scams.  Some of the major points were:",
            "Give no information to anyone that calls you no matter who they say they are unless you had previously initiated the call for a specific purpose.",
            "It is tax return season; the scammers are working very hard to get as much of that money as they can.",
            "Any caller that requests that you pay them using gift cards is a scammer.  No organization, whether a business, charity or a government office would never request gift cards.",
            "Fake charities are popping up especially with the Coronavirus flooding the news.  If you want to donate to a charity, do your homework and research the charity on your own first.  Do not let yourself be duped by a phone call.",
            "Beware of emotional trickery – such as saying the caller is a grandchild or some other family member that needs your financial help due to an emergency.",
            "Officer Blake also informed everyone of the correct phone numbers to use:  911 is ONLY for fire, crime IN PROGRESS, or a medical emergency.  The non-emergency number is 480-644-2211.  Use that for a crime that has already occurred and is no longer an emergency.",
            "Another helpful bit on information Officer Blake provided was that the MPD parking lot is an exchange parking lot that anyone in LPG can use if selling items and need to meet with the buyer.  She also stated that there will be an upcoming open house soon and that an email would go out to inform everyone of the date. She was very happy to say that with the new Police Chief coming in, there are going to be more officers hired.  The Superstition Mountain division (that is the division LGP is in) is going to be divided and the new officers will be added to facilitate the split.  She was not sure how soon that will happen.",
            "Margaret thanked Officer Blake for her informative talk and returned to the agenda.",
            "Treasurer Walt Smiles gave the Treasurers report.  He reported that last month LPGRA added $46.00 to the account as a result of the 50/50 raffle.  The current total balance is $350.40.  Motion was made to accept as presented, seconded and adopted."

            "Margaret referred to the “Open Items” list of concerns addressed with management.  She asked Dave Eason to address the stop signs and white lines.",
            "Dave explained the current status of the traffic signs the LPGRA has requested.  He explained that the Board submitted primary and secondary recommendations.  The primary recommendations for stop signs and white lines are:",
            "Grand Ave after entering the main gate and before you get to the first crosswalk.  Todd is checking to see if the sign could be moved up to coincide with the crosswalk and if not, then a white line painted on the road where the current stop sign is located.",
            "Clubhouse Drive West and Palm Circle – recommending a stop sign be added for westbound traffic and also white lines at each of the stop signs at that intersection",
            "At 3rd and 4th street intersections with Inverness.  Recommending white lines placed on both the East and West sides of those streets.  The stop signs locations are difficult to see due to placement or bushes.",
            "The secondary recommendations are:",
            "7th and Juniper Hills – white lines",
            "13th and Clubhouse Drive South – white line",
            "2nd and Clubhouse Drive – white line",
            "Margaret informed everyone that at our meeting with Management in February, Todd Lutz told us that he would counsel his maintenance crews about speeding within the community.  If there continues to be a problem, he will have governors placed on the utility carts so the maximum speed would be 15 mph.",
            "Green Waste – The large waste container is for LANDSCAPE waste ONLY.  It can be used by residents and the vendors residents contract with for yard maintenance only.  Todd Lutz is having cameras installed and possibly code readers if the problem continues.  Officer Blake informed us that American Furniture on Power Road will accept boxes as long as they are broken down.  American Furniture must be called first to let them know you are coming.",
            "ARB approval requests should be given to Karen.  Major projects like room additions may take up to 4-6 weeks for approval.  Projects like roofing and landscaping can be approved by Karen in a much shorter period of time.  If the work has been approved the resident will also receive a yellow card that must be placed in a front window of the home while the work is being completed.  You must turn in the yellow card when the job is completed so an inspection can be made.  A request was made to make the ARB forms more accessible.  Margaret will have them added as a download on the LPGRA website.",
            "The request for a bench on 1st Street has been approved and it will be installed as soon as it has been delivered.",
            "Bike Racks.  Todd said he will inspect the bike racks to see if there is a problem with the stability of the rack or if it may be the bikes themselves.  They really do not want to install them permanently as they need to move them at times for lawn work or activities going on in those areas.",
            "Cost of the Directory – We do not have an answer yet about the $4.00 cost after the 31st of March and will find out the response next week at our meeting with management.  The cost of the directory would be at least $10.00 if we did not have the advertisements in them.  Karen felt that that much of a cost would possibly deter people from purchasing them at all.  Margaret also informed everyone that the advertisers were not given any information about any resident within the community.  They have no access to the directory.",
            "Guest passes – Margaret explained the reasons behind no longer having the passes available as they were in the past.  There were over 2000 given out in 2019 and management found them being used improperly when family members would give them to friends to use the facilities here.  It was a big problem so management had to act accordingly.",
            "Basketball hoop -   It had some safety issues with broken bolts so Maintenance lowered the pole to the ground until the replacement parts were installed.  The work has been completed and the basketball hoop is fully functional again.",
            "New Personnel – Karen is working with her employees to try to improve attitudes and work habits.  Our request is for better PR when new staff is hired in the front.",
            "Margaret informed everyone of Todd Lutz’s comments at our meeting in February.  He is very pleased to be included in the monthly meeting and wants to be able to work with us to make sure LPG is truly the best place to live."

            "Neighborhood Watch had a report from Cal Anweiler.  He advised that the MPD building on Stephen Pollard Ave has a receptacle available just inside the door for disposal of any medications that you may have that are no longer needed or out of date.  They do not accept needles or any liquids but will take all other prescriptions.  No questions asked, you just drop them in the receptacle.  He also spoke about the Coronavirus and advise everyone present that the best way to deal with the threat is to wash your hands, keep your fingers away from your face and stay home if you are not feeling well at all."
